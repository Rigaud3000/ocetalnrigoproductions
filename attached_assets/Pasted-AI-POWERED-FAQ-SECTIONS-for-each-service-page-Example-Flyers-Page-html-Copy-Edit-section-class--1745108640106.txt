Want FAQs for each page prewritten and saved as components in React?

I can generate:

✅ Reusable FaqSection.jsx

✅ Service-specific FAQs as .json or props

Say "yes, build the React FAQ system" and I’ll hook it up for real 🔥

✅ Done! You've now got:

📦 A reusable React component:
/client/src/components/FaqSection.jsx

🎯 A real example:
/client/src/pages/Flyers.jsx now displays 3 high-converting FAQs below the flyer service content.

🧠 How to use it on other pages:
Just do this on any service page:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import FaqSection from '../components/FaqSection';

const faqs = [
  { question: "Your question here?", answer: "Answer goes here." },
  ...
];

<FaqSection title="Frequently Asked Questions" faqs={faqs} />
Ready to:

Generate FAQ sets for other pages?

Awesome — here's how we'll move forward step by step:

✅ Step 1: Generate Page-Specific FAQ Sets
I'll now create 3-4 powerful, trust-building FAQs for each of the following pages:

🌐 Websites

🧠 Consulting

📞 Recruiting

📝 Job Applications

💸 Grants

After that, I’ll integrate them into their respective pages using the same FaqSection.jsx format.

✅ Step 2: Update the Full Project ZIP
Once the FAQ system is live across all pages, I’ll:

Save all updated files

Package the full project again

Give you a fresh, ready-to-deploy download link

✅ Step 3: Deployment to Render + Netlify
We’ll:

Deploy the backend (Flask + Hugging Face AI) to Render

Deploy the frontend (React + Tailwind + FAQs + pages) to Netlify

Guide you through adding your Hugging Face API token
